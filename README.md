The proposed application is a voice-based mental fatigue detection system for university students. The system records short speech samples from students, extracts relevant acoustic features (e.g., pitch, jitter, shimmer, MFCCs, speaking rate), and feeds them into a pre-trained Random Forest classifier to distinguish between non-fatigued and fatigued states. The application provides real-time feedback on students’ mental fatigue level and can be integrated into learning management systems or used as a standalone tool in laboratories and counseling services.

This application offers several benefits, including early detection of mental fatigue, more objective monitoring of students’ cognitive load compared to self-report questionnaires, and decision support for lecturers and program managers in adjusting workload or referring students to counseling. It can be used in routine end-of-class monitoring, pre-exam screening, integration with campus counseling services, and as a research platform for developing more advanced fatigue detection models.
